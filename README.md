# Recommendation_Engine_IBM_data
Using the data provided by IBM, I have try to recommend new articles to users.

# Introduction

  For this project I have analyzed the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and made
  recommendations to them about new articles the program thinks they will like.
